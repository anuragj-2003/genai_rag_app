Types of Retrievers:
1. Vector-Based Retrievers: Use vector representations (embeddings) of text to find semantically similar documents. 
   - Good for: Concept-based queries, accurate semantic matching, finding related information even without exact keywords.
   - Pros: Accuracy for complex queries, flexibility (text, images).
   - Cons: Limited context understanding for ambiguous queries, scalability challenges.
   
2. Keyword-Based Retrievers: Traditional search matching exact words.
   - Good for: Exact phrase searching, specific technical terms, names.
   
3. Hybrid Retrievers: Combine Vector and Keyword strategies.
   - Good for: Balancing semantic understanding with exact matching.
   
4. Graph-Based / Contextual Retrievers: Use knowledge graphs or context.
   - Good for: Complex relationships, structured data querying.
   
5. Specialized (Time/Pattern):
   - Temporal: Time-based queries.
   - Pattern: Regex or specific pattern matching.

Steps in Retrieval:
1. Query Identification
2. Conversion (Tokenization/Embedding)
3. Matching (Similarity Search)
4. Response Generation
